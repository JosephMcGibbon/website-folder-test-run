        <p class = "minor_Heading">Importance Of Correct Political Information:</p>
        <p>Since correct political knowledge is the cornerstone of a robust democratic society, it is essential for educated and involved citizens. Accurate political knowledge empowers people to vote, support policies, and engage in civic affairs with knowledge and confidence. Holding elected officials accountable for their actions empowers voters to demand openness and accountability from the government. Misunderstandings, polarisation, and a decline in confidence in democratic institutions can result from inaccurate or misleading information. A knowledgeable public is better able to comprehend complicated topics, assess policies critically, and actively participate in public discourseâ€”all of which support a stronger and more resilient democracy.</p>

            <p class = "mini-heading">Voters</p>
            <p class = "normal-text">Voters may become confused by fake news since it provides false information. This has the potential to mislead people about topics and politicians. It also narrows the discourse to what individuals already believe, which might exacerbate conflict amongst them. The emergence of false news makes it more difficult for individuals to discern between what is and is not true. Voters may find it difficult to make wise choices as a result, and public confidence in the news may decline. Thus, false news undermines our democracy by making it more difficult for citizens to discern between reliable sources and the true nature of events.</p>

        <div class = "box-2">
            <p class = "mini-heading">Candidates</p>
            <p class = "normal-text">Fake news can have detrimental effects on political candidates by spreading false or misleading information about them. Inaccurate stories can damage a candidate's reputation, distort their positions on key issues, and even create false narratives around their personal lives. Such misinformation can influence public perception, leading voters to form opinions based on falsehoods rather than facts. Candidates may find it challenging to counteract these misleading narratives, as false information can spread quickly and be difficult to debunk. Additionally, the spread of fake news can contribute to a toxic political environment, fostering negativity, and undermining the credibility of candidates.</p>
