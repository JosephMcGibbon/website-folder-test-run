        <p>Narrative pushing refers to the intentional shaping or promotion of a particular storyline, perspective, or interpretation to influence public opinion or perception about a specific issue, event, or individual. It involves crafting a compelling and often biased narrative to sway people's understanding in a particular direction. This can be done through various means, including media coverage, social media, or political communication strategies. The goal of narrative pushing is to shape how people perceive information, events, or individuals, often with the aim of advancing a particular agenda or viewpoint.</p>

            <p class = "normal-text">Biased mainstream media may exhibit several characteristics that can be indicators of partiality or favoritism: <br>Selective Reporting: Biased media outlets may choose to report only certain aspects of a story that align with their perspective, while omitting information that contradicts their narrative.<br>Opinion Infusion: Biased reporting often includes the injection of opinions into news stories. This blurs the line between news and commentary, making it challenging for readers to distinguish between factual information and subjective interpretation.<br>Headline Manipulation: Biased headlines can frame a story in a way that emphasizes a particular viewpoint, even if the body of the article is more balanced. Misleading or provocative headlines are common signs of bias. </p>
